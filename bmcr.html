<h1 class="title">Response to Giambattista D’Alessio’s review of The Kallierges Pindar: A Study in Renaissance Greek Scholarship and Printing (2015)</h1>
<p>
My book is an interdisciplinary study, in which the first half deals with my
discovery that as many as ten sheets of the 1515 Kallierges <i>Pindar</i> have been
reset, most importantly at the beginning of the Pythian odes, where the first
four quires (64 pages) have the Greek text in two textually different
versions, which I call <i>Variant a</i> and <i>Variant b</i>. The second half of the book
deals mainly with the perhaps even more important discovery of a unique and
hitherto unknown document consisting of three densely set pages of Greek
prose whose contents are sensational from a book historical point of view.
</p>

<p>
The major disagreement between D’Alessio and myself concerns the correct order
of priority of the eight reset sheets of the Pythian odes. After a long and
careful physical examination of the book by applying methods of analytical
bibliography, I was finally able in 2015 to present the result of 25 years of
research, based on the evidence of 227 copies from upwards of 80 libraries on
two continents. The collected evidence indicated overwhelmingly that the
variant which was ultimately called <i>Variant a</i> was printed before <i>Variant b</i> —
hence the denominations. D’Alessio, however, is convinced that <i>Variant b</i> was
printed first.
</p>

<p>
Our disagreement has led to a clash between two different methods of textual
research. D’Alessio founds his opinion entirely on his own assessment of the
merits of conflicting variant readings in the two settings. This is fine for
an editor who is going to publish a new Greek edition, but is this a reliable
tool also for deciding the question of priority?
</p>

<p>
In chapter 4 (212) I explain why I have made little use of “one specific line
of argumentation that might seem relevant to the issue” [sc. that of priority]
“namely, which of the two variant readings is textually preferable in each
case and therefore likely to represent the second setting [&#x2026;]”. To show the
fallacy of this method I compared the stands taken by a number of modern
editors that showed that they were divided in their preferences in the choice
of variant readings: “To a great extent, assessment of variant readings always
was and always will be a matter of personal preference.” In other words, it
is useless as evidence in a case of priority and that is why I have
refrained from using it, contrary to D’Alessio, who makes it his preferred
category of evidence.
</p>

<p>
There is another method, however, that can give reliable answers, if the
questions and conditions are right. It is known as analytical bibliography and
involves an examination of the physical properties of the text-bearer, and,
by contrast, can yield 100% exact and reliable answers. This is the method I
have applied most of the time throughout the book, as it is the perfect tool
for answering my questions. It relies not on arbitrariness or personal
opinion, but on hard physical evidence that can never be disputed or explained
away and which is of an enormously higher evidential order than a discussion
of the supposed merits of this or that variant reading.
</p>

<p>
Like the great majority in the world of classical scholarship D’Alessio
obviously has never himself practised or come into contact with this method
and so may be excused for not realizing its enormous potential for supplying
relevant and trustworthy evidence. For the question of priority can <i>only</i> be
answered, or at least answered satisfactorily, by the application of
bibliographical method; this is exactly what I have done in my book. But
seventy pages of hard core evidence (120-194) cannot be repeated here.
</p>

<p>
It is true that regarding the numerous arguments for the priority of <i>Variant
a</i> that I have adduced, I have said that no one single argument alone is
strong enough to settle the matter once and for all (336). However, in doing
so I was referring to the kind of decisiveness with which the word is used in
the sciences: I was simply anxious not to overstate my case. D’Alessio,
however, seems to have misunderstood my caution as a confession that I myself
have doubts about the priority of <i>Variant a</i> and about other matters that are
expressed in an undogmatic way. This is not the case: many of the arguments
based on bibliographical evidence are absolutely compelling, if we are to rely
on sound logic.
</p>

<p>
There is no point in confronting his various arguments one by one as they will
all disappear at once as soon as it has become evident that <i>Variant a</i> was
set before <i>Variant b</i>. And such evidence there is. But since D’Alessio — who
never tries to disprove any of my many bibliographical arguments — seems to
be blind even to the most obvious facts, let me adduce one that gives
conclusive evidence once and for all that <i>Variant b</i> was set after <i>Variant
a</i>. And this is a new argument.
</p>

<p>
Bibliographical facts have made it evident that Kallierges began printing his
<i>Pindar</i> on two presses: one had its signatures in minuscules, the other in
majuscules. Kallierges was compositor for one of the presses, his foreman for
the other, but the famous printer of course supervised the work at both
presses. One press was going to print the Olympian odes and their scholia, the
other, the Pythian, Nemean and Isthmian odes. This means that one
press started with the first Olympian ode and the other, with the first
Pythian ode. (The preliminaries were set and printed last as usual.)
</p>

<p>
The early printers went to extreme lengths to make their books as perfect as
possible. And there was one thing that no printer, be he good or bad, would
ever do: he would never change the layout of the text once he had made up his
mind and started the typesetting.
</p>

<p>
The typesetting for the two presses started. Kallierges was the boss and he
decided to use the layout we meet on the first page of the Olympian odes.
Needless to say, his foreman at the other press was ordered to apply the same
layout for the Pythian odes — and so he did, thereby creating what I have
been referring to as <i>Variant a</i>; moreover, the layout of <i>Variant a</i> is exactly
the same as that of the rest of the book, thereby proving its original status,
as explained in the previous paragraph.
</p>

<p>
According to D’Alessio, however, the text of <i>Variant b</i> was set and printed
before that of <i>Variant a</i>. That would require that Kallierges would have to
have had a total mental breakdown the first day on the job and ordered his
foreman to apply a strikingly different layout for the Pythian odes, one with
negatively indented left-margin emphasis, headings in majuscules instead of
minuscules, etc. It would also require that Kallierges did not recover from
his unfortunate mental breakdown until after his foreman had set and printed
the fourth quire (i.e., after 64 pages), when Kallierges suddenly became his
normal self again and ordered his foreman from now on to apply the same layout
as the one he himself used for the Olympian odes.
</p>

<p>
Needless to say none of this ever happened, and could not have happened, and,
honestly, I do not think that D’Alessio would still claim that it did.
</p>

<p>
Yet someone set the four quires of <i>Variant b</i>. When was it done and why? These
questions are fully answered in my book and need not be repeated here in
detail, but, as so often, D’Alessio hides vital information from his readers,
for example, that also paper evidence proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that
the resetting was done as an extra job <i>after</i> all the regular quires had been
printed. This fact is mentioned a number of times in my book (192, 194, 234,
259-61, 275, 395, 402); hence, D’Alessio knows this very well, as well as the
fact that this is still another incontrovertible piece of evidence to prove
that <i>Variant b</i> was printed after <i>Variant a</i>.
</p>

<p>
Why was <i>Variant b</i>, a special edition, designed to stand out typographically?
A full answer to this question can be found in chapter 9. If D’Alessio had
read that chapter, he would not have suggested that <i>Variant b</i> was printed
first.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, D’Alessio thinks that the copy with the dedication to Musurus was
“printed <i>before</i> the preliminaries were reset (and, again, I see no obstacle
in the ‘analytical evidence generated by the physical examination’).”
</p>

<p>
My physical examination of the layout of the preliminaries of the “Musurus”
copy shows, again without the slightest doubt, that they were reset and that
the original was the ordinary preliminaries present in all known copies
(316-322), not the other way round as D’Alessio would have it. Moreover, every
resetting shows without a shadow of a doubt that the purpose of the resetting
was to make room for the long dedication while at the same time keeping as
much as possible of the original preliminary material: none of the resettings
was contextual. To manage this Kallierges had to make more than thirty
textual alterations, both large and small, all of them in the form of
amputation. Yet, D’Alessio sees “no obstacle in the ‘analytical evidence
generated by the physical examination’.” Personally, I could think of more
than thirty obstacles. As usual, D’Alessio gives no alternative reason for
these alterations. (The only piece of ‘evidence’ adduced by him is the usual
one: “It seems more natural to me…”).
</p>

<p>
In the text for note 1, D’Alessio appears to have spotted a mistake on my part
and takes the opportunity to put things right: the 1515 <i>Pindar</i> is not the
first Greek book printed in Rome as I have claimed, but “one of the first
Greek books printed in Rome.” Instead, with a reference to A. Rollo, D’Alessio
informs us that the first Greek book printed in Rome was <i>Operetta bellissima
da imparare la lingua greca composta per Paulo Enea</i>, printed in 1510. (This is
a short book of 22 pages only.)
</p>

<p>
However, this is not a Greek book. A Greek book should be completely in Greek,
or at least the major part of it: the 1515 <i>Pindar</i> is completely in Greek
except for the privilege on the title page, which is in Latin. The <i>Operetta
bellissima</i>, which is not even a Greek book — it is an Italian book! — has a
fair amount of Greek in it, but the major part of the text is not in Greek but
in Latin and Italian. Moreover, a Greek book would have the title in Greek
(the 1515 <i>Pindar</i> does); the <i>Operetta bellissima</i> does not, because it is not a
Greek book. In short: the Kallierges <i>Pindar</i> is still the first Greek book
printed in Rome — <i>pace</i> D’Alessio and Rollo.
</p>

<p>
That D’Alessio is not comfortable with arguments of a bibliographical nature
is evidenced also by the confusion that reigns in his bibliographical
descriptions. Speaking of the first quire of copy no. 134 which is a ternion,
he describes it as a quire consisting of three double leaves (i.e., three
pairs of conjugate leaves) “corresponding to six sheets and twelve pages” (2,
last paragraph). This does not make sense: twelve pages is correct, but six
sheets in quarto correspond to 48 pages. He goes on to explain that “all
copies bar one” begin with a binion (i.e., two pairs of conjugate leaves)
“corresponding to four sheets, and eight pages.” However, four sheets equal 32
pages. This confusion continues on the next page. “After a lacuna of … two
sheets, two further sheets are preserved…”. This is a misunderstanding: there
is no lacuna of two sheets (16 pages), nor are 16 further pages preserved. I
suspect that D’Alessio meant to write “leaves” instead of “sheets” in all
these instances.
</p>

<p>
However, these are not D’Alessio’s only confusing statements. On the second
page we find the following quotation: “Ultimately Fogelmark himself assesses
the evidence and the arguments for the priority of <i>Variant b</i> as in some cases
‘bordering on decisiveness’, but finds ‘none of them strong enough to settle
the matter once and for all’ (336).”
</p>

<p>
A Freudian slip?
